# Remix + MDX = Modern Blogging Superpowers

Remix has revolutionized the way we build web applications with its focus on web fundamentals and progressive enhancement. When combined with MDX (Markdown with JSX), it creates an incredibly powerful platform for content creation.

## Why This Combination Works So Well

MDX allows you to seamlessly blend Markdown with React components:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

;<Counter />
```

## Code Highlighting Demo

Syntax highlighting makes sharing code snippets a breeze:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`).then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('User not found')
    return response.json()
  })
}
```

## Leveraging Remix Data Loading

One of Remix's superpowers is its data loading capabilities, which work perfectly with MDX content:

```jsx
export const loader = async ({ params }) => {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  return { post }
}
```

This loader function allows us to fetch our MDX content and render it with all the interactive components intact.

## Markdown Features Still Work

Of course, all the standard Markdown features still work:

- **Bold text** and _italic text_
- > Blockquotes for important callouts
- Lists and nested lists
  - Like this subitem
  - And this one

## Conclusion

Remix + MDX gives you the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown for content creation with the power of React components for interactivity. This combination is perfect for creating modern, interactive blog posts that engage your readers.
